# Mepylome: Methylation Array Analysis Toolkit

Mepylome is an efficient Python toolkit tailored for parsing, processing, and
analyzing methylation array IDAT files. Serving as a versatile library,
Mepylome supports a wide range of methylation analysis tasks. It also includes
an interactive GUI that enables users to generate UMAP plots and CNV plots
(Copy Number Variation) directly from collections of IDAT files.


## Features

- Parsing of IDAT files
- Extraction of methylation signals
- Calculation of Copy Number Variations (CNV) with visualization using
  [plotly](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.py).
- Support for the following Illumina array types: 450k, EPIC, EPICv2
- Significantly faster compared to [minfi](https://github.com/hansenlab/minfi)
  and [conumee2](https://github.com/hovestadtlab/conumee2).
- Methylation analysis tool with a graphical browser interface for UMAP
  analysis, CNV plots and supervised classification
  - Can be run from the command line with minimal setup or customized through a
    Python script


## Documentation

The mepylome documentation, including installation instructions, tutorial and API, is available at <https://mepylome.readthedocs.io/>


## Usage

### Methylation extraction and copy number variation plots

```python
from pathlib import Path

from mepylome import CNV, MethylData

# Sample
analysis_dir = Path("/path/to/idat/directory")
sample_file = analysis_dir / "200925700125_R07C01"

# CNV neutral reference files
reference_dir = Path("/path/to/reference/directory")

# Get methylation data
sample_methyl = MethylData(file=sample_file)
reference_methyl = MethylData(file=reference_dir)

# Beta value
betas = sample_methyl.betas

# Print overview of processed data
print(sample_methyl)

# CNV anylsis
cnv = CNV.set_all(sample_methyl, reference_methyl)

# Visualize CNV in the browser
cnv.plot()
```

### Methylation analysis: Command-line interface and GUI

<img alt="Mepylome Logo" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brj0/mepylome/main/docs/images/screenshot.png">

#### Basic usage:

Mepylome provides a command-line interface for launching a GUI and performing
methylation analysis. Ensure you have an analysis directory, a CNV reference
directory, and an annotation file (located within the analysis directory). Use
the following command to initiate the analysis:

```sh
mepylome --analysis_dir /path/to/idats --reference_dir /path/to/ref
```

If you want to perform a **quick test**, use:

```sh
mepylome --tutorial
```

This command downloads sample IDAT files and provides a demonstration of the
package's functionality.

See <https://mepylome.readthedocs.io/> for details.


## C++ parser

Mepylome also includes a C++ parser. See <https://mepylome.readthedocs.io/> for
details.
